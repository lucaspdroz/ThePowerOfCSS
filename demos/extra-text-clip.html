            If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own
            nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see what others do.
            A man is but a product of his thoughts. What he thinks he becomes.
            I will not let anyone walk through my mind with their dirty feet.Nobody can hurt me without my
            permission.Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.The weak can never
            forgive. Forgiveness is an attribute of the strong.An ounce of practice is worth a thousand words.A coward
            is incapable of exhibiting love; it is the prerogative of the brave.Live as if you were to die tomorrow.
            Learn as if you were to live forever.Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make
            mistakes.Service which is rendered without joy helps neither the servant nor the served.If we are to teach
            real peace in this world, and if we are to carry on a real war against war, we shall have to begin with the
            children.The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.In a gentle way, you can
            shake the world. If I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if
            I may not have it at the beginning.Hate the sin, love the sinner.Glory lies in the attempt to reach one’s
            goal and not in reaching it.Whenever you are confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love.Permanent
            good can never be the outcome of untruth and violence.The future depends on what you do today.To give
            pleasure to a single heart by a single act is better than a thousand heads bowing in prayer.Earth provides
            enough to satisfy every man’s needs, but not every man’s greed.It’s the action, not the fruit of the action,
            that’s important. You have to do the right thing. It may not be in your power, may not be in your time, that
            there’ll be any fruit. But that doesn’t mean you stop doing the right thing. You may never know what results
            come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result.Strength does not come from physical
            capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.You don’t know who is important to you until you actually lose
            them.I cannot conceive of a greater loss than the loss of one’s self-respect.You must not lose faith in
            humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.
            If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own
            nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. We need not wait to see what others do.
